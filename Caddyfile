# Caddy configuration for reverse proxy and static file serving

# This block handles requests coming from the Tor hidden service (internal port 80)
# It reverse proxies to the target website.
:80 {
    # Reverse proxy to the specified website
    reverse_proxy https://radiant-marigold-cffbde.netlify.app {
        # Pass original Host header to the backend
        # X-Forwarded-For is passed by default, so this line is redundant.
        # header_up X-Forwarded-For {http.request.remote}
        header_up X-Real-IP {http.request.remote.host}
    }
}

# This block handles requests for the keep-alive HTML page
# It will listen on the port provided by Render's environment variable (e.g., 8080).
# Render handles public HTTPS termination, so Caddy should listen on HTTP internally.
:{$PORT} {
    # Removed 'tls off' as it was causing a parsing error.
    # Caddy will default to serving HTTP on this port when no 'tls' directive is present,
    # which is what Render expects for internal communication.
    # Serve files from the /usr/share/caddy/html directory
