# Caddy configuration for reverse proxy and static file serving

# This block handles requests coming from the Tor hidden service (internal port 80)
# It reverse proxies to the target website.

    # Reverse proxy to the specified website
    reverse_proxy https://2305878273.7844380499.cfd {
        # Pass original Host header to the backend
        # X-Forwarded-For is passed by default, so this line is redundant.

        header_up X-Real-IP {http.request.remote.host}

# This block handles requests for the keep-alive HTML page
# It will listen on the port provided by Render's environment variable (e.g., 8080).
# Render handles public HTTPS termination, so Caddy should listen on HTTP internally.
